# Intel 8080 Emulator - Year 1 University Project

## Task
To emulate the entire instruction set of an Intel 8080 processor, the seminal 8-bit chip that sparked a computing revolution when it was released in 1974. More info here: http://www.cpu-world.com/CPUs/8080/

## Assessment
The code is run against a marking server, ran locally. The server tests each instruction in turn and returns the final grade, plus a breakdown of marks per instruction.

> ** I still have the marking server executable, but as it is compiled code I did not write, I'm not going to distribute it **

## Result
I got 59% - I thought this was a very difficult assignment to give as a second ever programming assignment.  Some people on our course had never even coded before - even I only had one summer's experience with Java. Quite frankly I'm stunned I did as well as I did!

## Forking
Go ahead and see if you can complete the instructions! I guess you can delete the marking code - no use for that now. I can point you to some good resources that detail the 8080's original instructions.
